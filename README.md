This paper proposed a new application of K-means clustering algorithm. Due to ease of implementation and application, K-means algorithm can be widely used. However, one of the disadvantages of clustering algorithms is that there is no balance between the clustering algorithm and its applications, and many researchers have paid less attention to clustering algorithm applications. The purpose of this paper is to apply the clustering algorithm application to face extraction. An improved K-means clustering algorithm was proposed in this study. A new method was also proposed for the use of clustering algorithms in image processing. To evaluate the proposed method, two case studies were used, including four standard images and five images selected from LFW standard database. These images were reviewed first by the K-means clustering algorithm and then by the RER-K-means and FE-RER-clustering algorithms. This study showed that the K-means clustering algorithm could extract faces from the image and the proposed algorithm used for this work increased the accuracy rate and, at the same time, reduced the number of iterations, intra cluster distance, and the related processing time.
